# @version ^0.3.3
# @title CrudeRescue
#
# @notice This is a simple implementation of a rescue contract in vy
# Can test by sending your usdc to the sushi router on goerli and deploying this with a bit of eth.
#
# Usually don't have time to use these as bots will back run a users mistake, but sometimes you will, 
#  and they have saved significant sums.
#
# Can add more calls to be precise with amounts, unwrap the dust, self destruct or have a withdraw function.
# But for simplicity this is a relatively stripped down example to test the new dynamic arrays in vyper.
